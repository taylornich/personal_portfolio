The Personal Portfolio showases my work thus far through the Coding Temple course. It also includes my personal background and some additional information about me.

The project consists of several files including home.html, about_me.html, projects.html, skills.html, contact.html
'home.html' - The homepage of the portfolio.
'about_me.html' - A page containing personal information and my career goals.
'projects.html' - A page showcasing several projects.
'skills.html' - A page listing skills I have obtained through Coding Temple.
'contact.html' - A page with a contact form and contact information, including how to connect on social media.

1. Download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the HTML files in a browser
   For windows users:
     Double-click on the 'home.html' file
     If using the terminal, use the command 'start home.html'
   For macOS users:
